## Memo

We can create new movement:
```
onoremap p i(
```

`p` stands for parameter.

We can think of operator-pending movement like this(this is from book):

1. Start at the cursor position
2. Enter visual mode(charwise)
3. ... mapping keys go here ...
4. All the text you want to include in the movement should now be selected.

Also we can change the start.

example:
```
:onoremap in( :<c-u>normal! f(vi(<cr>
```

We can think of this like:

> inside next parentheses

Put the cursor on somewhere in the word `print` and type `cin(`

```
print foo(bar)
```

### General two rules

These are also from the book.

- If your operator-pending mapping ends with some text visually selected, Vim will operate on that text.
- Otherwise, Vim will operate on the text between the original cursor position and the new position.

## Exercise
```
:onoremap ar( :<c-u>normal! f(va(<cr>
:onoremap ar( :<c-u>normal! F)va(<cr>
:onoremap in{ :<c-u>normal! f{vi{<cr>
:onoremap in{ :<c-u>normal! F}vi{<cr>
:onoremap ar{ :<c-u>normal! f{va{<cr>
:onoremap ar{ :<c-u>normal! F}va{<cr>
```
