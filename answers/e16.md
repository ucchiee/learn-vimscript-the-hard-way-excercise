## Memo

`:normal!` doesn't recognize the special character like <cr>.
Typical way around this is to use `:execute`.

`$` will hightlight the new line character. We'll use `g_` instead

## Exercise
```
:onoremap ah :<c-u>execute "normal! ?^==\\+$\r:nohlsearch\rg_vk0"<cr>
```

```
augroup md_headline
  autocmd!
augroup END
```
